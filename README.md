# Mysterian

An application for designing and hosting murder mystery games.

Upon signing up, a user can create a game, of which they are the game
master. The game master can then add characters to their game, with
character sheets and abilities (kill, save, steal, etc.)

Game masters can send email invitations to their friends to play in their game.
Upon receiving an invite code, the friend can log in or create an account,
at which time they are added to the game as a player. Players can view information
for their own character, but cannot see the information for other characters.
